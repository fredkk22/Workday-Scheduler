## Description

This Module 5 Challenge was to create a workday scheduler for the user to be able to record any meetings, dues, or plans through the workday and keep their hourly schedule stored on the application even after refreshing the page.

The reason for creating a random password generator was to practice coding in jQuery, moment.js, and bootstrap for use in practical applications.

I was able to learn everything I listed above and have become much more comfortable using jQuery, moment.js, and Bootstrap. I still have yet to gain more experience in all of them, but I feel the most confident in jQuery and the least confident in Bootstrap as of right now.
